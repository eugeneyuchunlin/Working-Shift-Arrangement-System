# Working Shift Arrangement System

This is the user interface of the working shift arrangement program which I develope for the Building Management Department of Windsor Hotel,  Taichung(台中裕元花園酒店). If you want to learn more about the detail, you can visit the [repo]("https://github.com/yuchun1214/Working-Shift-Scheduling").

### Shift Arrangement

In this page, user can edit the shift directly by typing on the shift, and click **Save** button to save the edited shift into database or click **Calculate** button to calculate the shift. The **operating research algorithm** is employed to calculate the shift.
